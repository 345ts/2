       <h1>Rophnan</h1>
       
       <p><strong> 17 May 2018, Rophnan released his debut album Reflection.</strong> This was the first electronic music LP to ever be released in Ethiopia. The album was released independently by RAEY Records. A shorter version of the album, named Reflection E.P. was released by the Ghanaian label Akwaaba Music. Reflection was deeply rooted in raw traditional Ethiopian music but also mixing futuristic aesthetics into the powerful songs which reflected Rophnan's generation and artistic vision. Introducing a new musical message, the album took a little while to be absorbed by the Ethiopian market, but in just a few months, the album's reach expanded from clubs, to street corners, to radio stations and finally became the most played album of the year. Respectively, Rophnan became one of the most celebrated artists in the country. The release of the album coincided with a governmental change which brought consciousness to the youth of Ethiopia, and Reflection became the soundtrack of those winds of change. Soon after the album release Rophnan has performed live in the popular Ehud Be EBS TV show where he delivered a 10-minute set of live music, becoming the first artist ever to not lip-sync on the show. The video went viral and was viewed by millions.

        The album won Rophnan three 2018's Leza Awards including Album of The Year, becoming a ground breaking release for an emerging genre.[5]
        
       <em> In his acceptance <strong> staying true</strong> to the generation who brought him to this point in his career, Rophnan said:</em>
        Reflection is an album where I reflected myself, my country and my generation.... I want to say to my younger brothers and sisters, use the computers, internet and smartphones you have in your reach for bigger things.

       <I>Rophnan </I>gained a sweeping number of fans (stylized as Phans) by being a representative of a new generation's creative force in Ethiopia. This status manifested itself in an unprecedented scope of digital following, memes, fan art and social trends.
